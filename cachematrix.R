#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix, which is really a list containing a function to

## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get,setinverse=setinverse,getinverse=getinverse)
	   
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special matrix created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inveerse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data.")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

}
